This website is built using 11ty.dev, same format as Jekyll but written in JavaScript.

You will need node.js installed on your machine in order to use this, once installed open a terminal cd into the folder you checked out this code and run

`npm install`

Once complete run

`npx @11ty/eleventy --watch`

This will compile everything into the `_site` folder
